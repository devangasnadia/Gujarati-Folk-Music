    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Gujarati folk music, is a hereditary vocation practised by the Barot, Gadhvi, and Charan communities. 
        Wind instruments like the turi, bungal, and pava, as well as string instruments, are frequently used in 
        Gujarati folk music. The percussion instruments manjira and zanz pot drum, as well as the ravan hattho, 
        ektaro, and jantar.Gujarati folk music is extremely diverse. Bhajan, a sort of poetry used in devotional 
        songs, is divided into categories based on the poetry's or songs' musical accompaniments, such as Prabhati,
        Katari, Dhol, etc.

        The state's most well-known folk musical genres include charani, duha, chhand,
        and others. One gains an understanding of the intricate cultural and geographic history of that particular location after listening 
        to these folk tunes.Gujarati classical music is also a wonderful example of gujarati music and 
        is a very old form of gujarati music. Some of Gujarat's beautiful ragas are named for the places or people who gave rise to them. Gujarat 
        has produced many well-known musicians. In Champaner, Nayak Baiju was born. He allegedly defeated Tansen in a musical competition and as a 
        result gained the reputation of a wonderful musician. Omkarnath Thakur, one of the best voices of 20th-century Indian classical music, was a 
        prominent performer of Gujarati descent in more recent times. He reportedly used his singing to treat Mussolini's insomnia, which is an 
        intriguing tale. Omkarnath excelled as a performer, educator, and theorist. Gujarat has made tremendous contributions over the centuries,
        yet today there are only a few Gujaratis who are represented in Indian classical music.

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
        Gujarat offers a wide variety of folk music. There is music everywhere and it can be heard all across this state. 
        There are several geographical and cultural diversity within the state, and the music reflects these changes as well. 
        These musical genres are very different from one another, but they all share the distinctive scent of Gujarati sand, 
        which they all proudly wear including me. The state's most well-known folk musical genres include charani, duha, chhand,
        and others.

        One gains an understanding of the intricate cultural and geographic history of that particular location after listening 
        to these folk tunes. In this state, music is employed for more than just amusement. As a Gujarati, I have seen that
        Gujarati People go to listen to performers who use music to convey both social and religious messages during 
        performances of Dayro and Lokvarta. Elegiac music known as marsiyas has its roots in Marsiya. Lagna-geets or fattannas 
        are simple songs that are played during weddings.

    <h2>Influence</h2>
    <p>
        The most popular form of folk music which is also one of my favourites is Raas Garba. The Festival of Nine Nights, also known as 
        Navratri Utsav, inspires Gujarati cities to light up with colour, dance, and music from September through October. Gujarat has Navratri 
        celebrations in both large cities and tiny villages. During Navratri, Amba Mata, the soil goddess who grants strength and power against 
        the powers of evil, receives special worship through Ras Garba dances and temple pujas. These dances often start at eleven o'clock at night 
        and go until daybreak at various locations throughout the city. Gujarati classical music is also a wonderful example of gujarati music and 
        is a very old form of gujarati music. Some of Gujarat's beautiful ragas are named for the places or people who gave rise to them.
